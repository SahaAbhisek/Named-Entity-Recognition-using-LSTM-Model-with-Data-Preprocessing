# Named Entity Recognition using LSTM

### In this project, we will build an LSTM model, train it to make Named Entity Recognition predictions.

### Work-Flow:

* We will preprocess the data.
* We will create ids for each individual word and tags for all the sentences together.
* We will group words and tags by the sentences.
* We will pad each sentence with the max length of the length of the largest sentence.
* We will make an LSTM model and train it to predict the test data.
* We will then evaluate the model.
